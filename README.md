# 🛠 Python for Network Engineers – Practice Exercises

This repository contains hands-on Python exercises designed specifically for **Network Engineers** who want to strengthen their automation, scripting, and troubleshooting skills.

Each exercise mirrors real-world networking tasks such as log parsing, monitoring, system command execution, configuration filtering, and file system inspection.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

Modern network engineers are expected to:

* Automate operational tasks
* Parse logs and router configurations
* Monitor system metrics
* Work with system commands
* Handle structured and unstructured data

These exercises simulate exactly those real-world scenarios using Python fundamentals.

---

## 🧠 Skills Reinforced

* Core Python syntax
* Control flow and conditionals
* String manipulation
* Working with dictionaries and lists
* Interacting with the operating system
* Writing production-style defensive code

---

## 🚀 Who This Is For

* Network Engineers learning Python
* CCNA/CCNP engineers transitioning into automation
* NOC engineers automating monitoring tasks
* Anyone preparing for network automation interviews

---

## 🔧 How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run each script independently.
3. Modify exercises to expand functionality.
4. Try rewriting solutions in different ways (e.g., without regex, using list comprehensions, etc.).

---

## 📈 Suggested Next Steps

After completing these exercises, consider exploring:

* REST APIs and interacting with network controllers
* Parsing JSON/YAML configuration files
* Automating device configuration backups
* Building small monitoring dashboards

---

## 🏁 Goal

The goal of this repository is not just to write Python — it is to think like an automation-focused Network Engineer.
